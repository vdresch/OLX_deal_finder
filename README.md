# OLX deal finder
## A python script that monitors a product on OLX and emits an alert if it finds a deal ##

To run, it's required to have all the packages on requirements.txt installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It's also needed to change the server, login, password and port on config.yml. Also on that file, there will be the max amount of pages to be scraped.

To run, you'll need to pass two arguments: first, the link for the first page of the desired product; second, how cheap the product needs to be to be considered a deal.

```
python deal_finder.py {link} {deal}
```
Example:
```
python deal_finder.py "https://rs.olx.com.br/autos-e-pecas/motos/bmw/g/650" "21000"
```
There will be an email alert for every new deal found. Every deal sent will be stored in a SQLite db, so it won't be scraped again.

I apologise to the BMW G650 owners that I inflated the views during development. My bad!
